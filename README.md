# 3pin-led-rockerswitch-studies-today

## Overview
This repository documents the installation of LED lights controlled via 3-pin rocker switches, using a fuse tap and additional fuse board. It serves as a guide and reference for enthusiasts working on similar automotive lighting projects.

The project is primarily focused on wiring and installing the following components:
- Fuse Tap
- 3-pin Rocker Switches
- LED Light Strips
- Circuit Fuse Board

## Installation Process

    Prepare the Components: Cut the necessary lengths of wire and gather all tools.
    Wire the Rocker Switches: Follow the detailed step-by-step instructions located in /instructions/setup.md.
    Install Fuse Tap: Use the fuse tap to safely draw power from your vehicle's existing fuse box.
    Mount LED Strips: Secure the LED lights along the front of your car and connect them to the circuit.
    Test: Reconnect the battery and test all connections to ensure the switches control the LEDs as expected.

Circuit Diagram

The circuit diagram for wiring the 3-pin rocker switches and LEDs can be found in the /diagrams folder. It shows the pin layout, ground connections, power inputs, and the LED output wiring for clarity.
Usage

Once installed, use the rocker switches to turn on/off the LED strips independently. The setup ensures that each LED strip has a dedicated switch, with power routed through the additional fuse box for extra protection.
Future Additions

Add video tutorial for the installation process

    Introduce additional features like dimmer switches or multicolor LED control
